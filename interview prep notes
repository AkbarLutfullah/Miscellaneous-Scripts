NLP

NLP is a field within AI, that gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages
Human languages typically in the form of speech and/or text
Intersection of human languages and data science
Common use case of NLP is amazons alexa and apples siri, these are examples of intellegent voice driven interfaces that use NLP to respond to vocal prompts and do evertyhing
Another case of NLP is in selection phases of talent recruitment, identifying skills of potential hires and spotting prospects before they come on the market

1. What are the data types used in Python?

string
list
tuple
dict
set
number (float int)

2. Explain the difference between lists and tuples.

lists are mutable whilst tuples are immutable
both are data types in python that hold values of your data
lists are represented by []
and tuples are represented by ()

3. What is a Python dictionary?

another data type in python and are muttable 
they are represented by {}
it defines an unordered mapping of by keys and values 
my_dict = {'name': 'Hugh Jackman', 'age': 50, 'films': ['Logan', 'Deadpool 2', 'The Front Runner']}
my_dict['age']

4. What are lambda functions?
Lambda functions are anonymous functions in Python. They’re very helpful when you need to define a function that’s very short and consists of only one expression. So, instead of formally defining the small function with a specific name, body, and return statement, you can write everything in one short line of code using a lambda function.

Here’s an example of how lambda functions are defined and used:

(lambda x, y, z: (x+y) ** z)(3,2,2)
25

5. Explain list comprehensions and how they’re used in Python.
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

A list is traditionally created using square brackets. But with a list comprehension, these brackets contain an expression followed by a for clause and then if clauses, when necessary. Evaluating the given expression in the context of these for and if clauses produces a list.

It’s best explained with an example:

old_list = [1, 0, -2, 4, -3]
new_list = [x**2 for x in old_list if x > 0]
print(new_list)

6. What is a negative index, and how is it used in Python?
A negative index is used in Python to index a list, string, or any other container class in reverse order (from the end). Thus, [-1] refers to the last element, [-2] refers to the second-to-last element, and so on.

Here are two examples:

list = [2, 5, 4, 7, 5, 6, 9]
print (list[-1])
9
text = "I love data science"
print (text[-3])
n

7. Name some well-known Python data analysis libraries.
If you’re doing data analysis with Python, you’re likely going to use:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SciKit
These libraries will help you work with arrays and DataFrames, build professional-looking plots, and run machine learning models.

8. What is pandas?

Pandas is a Python open-source library that provides high-performance and flexible data structures and data analysis tools that make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.

9. Write Python code to create an employees DataFrame from the “HR.csv” file.
We can create a DataFrame from a CSV file by using the read_csv() function from the pandas library. By convention, pandas is imported as pd. So the code is simply the following:

import pandas as pd
emloyees = pd.read_csv('HR.csv')

10. What is the default missing value marker in pandas, and how can you detect all missing values in a DataFrame?
In pandas, the default missing value marker is NaN.

You can detect all missing values in a DataFrame by using the isna() function from the pandas library:

employees.isna()

11. Write Python code to select the Department and Age columns from the employees DataFrame.
You can select multiple columns from a DataFrame by passing in their names to double square brackets:

employees[['Department', 'Age']]

12. Add a new column named Active to the employees DataFrame with all 1s to indicate each employee’s active employment status.
You can create a new column with a particular value for all entries by simply assigning this value to the whole column:

employees['Active'] = 1
employees.head()

13. Write Python code to plot the distribution of employees by age.
To plot the distribution of employees by age, you’ll simply need to create a histogram from the Age column of the employees DataFrame. This can be done by calling the hist() function on the selected column:

employees['Age'].hist()

14. What libraries do data scientists use to plot data in Python?
Matplotlib is the main library used for plotting data in Python. However, the plots created with this library need lots of fine-tuning to look shiny and professional. For that reason, many data scientists prefer Seaborn, which allows you to create appealing and meaningful plots with only one line of code.

15. What Python IDEs are the most popular in data science?
Granted, you won’t be asked this exact question, but it’s likely that your prospective employer will still want to get a better sense of how you work with Python and what exposure you have to the language.

In that case, it’s good to know that Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, and Spyder are all good Python IDEs, but Jupyter Notebook is arguably the best for data science.
